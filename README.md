# Surprise Housing Price Prediction Project 🏘️

Welcome to the **Surprise Housing Project** repository! This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features such as house size, location, and more. The aim is to use machine learning techniques, including **Ridge** and **Lasso Regression**, to develop a robust prediction model. Along the way, significant emphasis was placed on **data processing**, **feature extraction**, and **model optimization**.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project involves:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🧠: Gaining insights into the dataset and visualizing key patterns.
- **Data Processing** 🛠️: Cleaning and transforming the dataset to make it suitable for modeling.
- **Feature Extraction & Engineering** 🧬: Creating new features and selecting the most relevant ones.
- **Building Machine Learning Models** 🤖: Using Ridge and Lasso Regression to predict housing prices.
- **Model Evaluation** ✅: Assessing model performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

---

## 🚀 Key Features:
- **Data Processing**: Addressing skewness, handling missing data, outlier treatment, and converting data types.
- **Feature Engineering**: Crafting new features, analyzing correlations, and selecting important features for modeling.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Using **Ridge** and **Lasso Regression** to build predictive models.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance measured using **cross-validation** and error metrics.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Highlights
- **SalePrice Distribution**: Initial data showed skewness and high kurtosis. Skewness was reduced after transformations.
- **Outliers**: Identified and handled outliers in variables such as `LotFrontage`, `YearBuilt`, and `LotArea`.
- **Correlations**: Found highly correlated features such as `GarageArea` and `GarageCars`, which helped in feature selection.

---

## 🧠 Key Insights:
- **Feature Relationships**: 
  - `GarageArea` and `GarageCars` had a strong relationship with house prices.
  - Categorical features like `MSZoning` and `Street` showed a dominant distribution in a single category.
- **Model Performance**:
  - Both Ridge and Lasso regression performed well, but **Lasso** excelled at simplifying the model by reducing less important features to zero.

## 📈 Model Performance:
| Model       | R-Squared | Mean Squared Error (MSE) |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------------|
| **Ridge**   | 0.85      | Low                      |
| **Lasso**   | 0.83      | Low                      |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used:
- **Python** 🐍: The primary programming language used in the project.
- **Pandas & NumPy** 🐼: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📊: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn** 🤖: For building machine learning models (Ridge and Lasso).

---

## 🤔 Future Work:
- Explore **Elastic Net Regression** to combine the strengths of both Ridge and Lasso.
- Incorporate external data (e.g., economic indicators) to further improve predictions.
- Implement additional techniques for feature selection and model optimization.
